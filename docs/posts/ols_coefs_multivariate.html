<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The cost function for OLS is the sum of squared residuals, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\epsilon}^{\intercal}\hat{\epsilon}\)</span>. In order to fit a good linear model, we want to find optimum values for the estimated vector of coefficients, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}^*\)</span>, that minimizes this cost function.</p>
<p>First we do partial differentiation of the cost function with respect to the coefficients. Finding the coefficient values where the partial differential is equal to zero reveals the stationary points of the cost function. For OLS in particular, we can find a unique solution for the choice of coefficients that can be found analytically. The hessian matrix then further proves that this is a global minima.</p>

<p>Now we find the choices of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> where the partial differential is equal to zero. These stationary points for the cost function are either at its maximum or minimum.</p>
<p>For OLS - we actually only find one unique solution!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
\cancel{2}X^{\intercal}y +  \cancel{2}((X^{\intercal}X)\hat{\beta}) &amp; = 0 \\
\therefore (X^{\intercal}X)\hat{\beta} &amp; = X^{\intercal}y \\
\therefore \hat{\beta} &amp; = (X^{\intercal}X)^{-1}X^{\intercal}y
\end{align}
}

<p>Note the need to invert <span class="math inline">\(X^{\intercal}X\)</span>. This is only possible for a full rank matrix.</p>
</div></div><p>The first term is the (inverse) variance matrix of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. This term normalizes the coefficient with respect to the magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>The second term is the covariance matrix between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. This incorporates the linear relationship between the two in the coefficient.</p>
<p>Hence, the coefficient can be interpreted as the estimated change in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> given a one unit change in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="check-the-stationary-point-is-a-global-minimum-hessian-matrix">4. Check the stationary point is a global minimum (hessian matrix)</h3>
<p>Finally, we derive the <strong>hessian matrix</strong>, by double-differentiating the cost function with respect to the coefficients:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\displaylines{
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\hat{\beta}\partial\hat{\beta}^{\intercal}}
\left(
  \hat{\epsilon}^{\intercal}\hat{\epsilon}
\right)
\\ = \frac{\partial}{\partial \hat{\beta}^{\intercal}} \left( -2X^{\intercal}y +  2((X^{\intercal}X)\hat{\beta}) \right)
\\ = 2(X^{\intercal}X)^{\intercal}
}
\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(X^{\intercal}X\)</span> is clearly positive definite, the cost function is convex. Thus, we know our unique solution for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> where the partial differential is at zero is indeed a <strong>global minimum</strong> for the cost function.</p>

<p>Unlike logistic regression, or the multiple hidden-layer structure of neural networks, we can “jump” straight to the optimum coefficients for OLS. Why can we do this? Well chiefly its because OLS is a bit of a special case:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The minima is a global minima:</strong> The hessian matrix is positive definite, and hence the cost function is strictly convex. This means we know that when a choice of coefficients is found that ensure the partially differentiated cost function is equal zero, this minima is also a global one, not a local one.</li>
<li><strong>There is only one solution for the optimum coefficient:</strong> We assume that the matrix is full rank (every feature provides additional predictive power) and that the number of predictors is smaller than the number of obervations. This also means that partially differentiating is okay to do!</li>
<li><strong>A closed-form solution can be found:</strong> The predictions are generated from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> using a simple, purely algebraic function, i.e.&nbsp;the sum-product of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. This means we can find an analytical solution to the optimal choice <span class="math inline">\(\beta^*\)</span>. Note this often isn’t possible since non-linear activation functions (i.e.&nbsp;link functions) are often transcendental. In this case, we need iterative methods, such as gradient descent or Newton’s method: <a href="glm_exponential_dispersion.html">see this page for more details</a>.</li>
