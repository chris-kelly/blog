<p>Imagine we are throwing darts, aiming at a circular target. The closer you get to the centre, the more points you get.</p>
<p>Imagine you miss the centre by 5cm. It doesn’t matter whether you were 5cm too high or low, 5cm too far left or right, or a combination of the two (e.g.&nbsp;3cm too far left, 4cm too far right, which by pythagoras is also <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5\text{cm}\)</span> away from the centre) - hitting those regions are all equally likely.</p>

<p>Now having said that, the distribution of horizontal distances from the centre are completely independent of the distribution of vertical distances. We are just trying to aim for the middle: getting less or more accurate horizontally doesn’t affect how accurate we are vertically.</p>
<p>Let’s denote the horizontal and vertical distances from the centre <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Now here is the magic - after taking many shots, we would find that <strong>the distribution of vertical distances from the centre of the target would follow a normal distribution</strong>!</p>
<p>We would also find the horizontal distances form the centre of the target would follow a normal distribution too!</p>

<p>Seems like very, very few assumptions needed to know that the horizontal and vertical distances will follow a normal distribution? That’s true! But it works. This is the Herschel-Maxwell theorem.</p>

<p>Given two random variables, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, with a joint distribution function of <span class="math inline">\(P_{X,Y}(dX,dY)\)</span>:</p>

<li><span class="math inline">\(P_{X,Y}\)</span> is invariant to real rotations</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span> are independent</li>
</ol>
<p>Then both <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are normally distributed.</p>

<p>And this is the theorem that we will prove in this post.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="first-step---combining-the-two-assumptions">First step - combining the two assumptions</h2>
<p>The horizontal and vertical distances from the centre are two random variables, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, that are independently and identically generated from a distribution with identical population parameters (mean of zero and finite, constant variance).</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>We do not expect a bias in aiming too high or too low. Hence the expected values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (their means) are zero: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{E}[X]=0\text{; }\mathbb{E}[Y]=0\)</span></p>
<p>Also, we want to hit closer to the centre. Hence the probability density must diminish with large values of <span class="math inline">\(|x|\)</span>, as it is more likely we get closer - so the variance of these distances is finite. Also, by making the variance constant, we assume that we do not get better over time. <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{V}[X]=c_X\text{; }\mathbb{V}[Y]=c_Y\)</span></p>
</div></div><p>Let’s now derive the normal distribution from first principles. We rewrite the Herschel-Maxwell theorem above as our starting point:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The probability of hitting a point on the target is radially symmetric</li>
<li>The horizontal and vertical distances from the centre are independent (unrelated)</li>
</ol>
<p>What does this really mean? Well (1) means there is “radial symmetry”. In other words, the likelihood of a shot ending in some region is only based on how close it is to the centre: it doesn’t matter how far the distance is along the horizontal or vertical axis (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>), just the combined distance (i.e.&nbsp;the radius from the centre).</p>

<p>Concretely - the joint probability between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for two shots landing in any region equidistant from the origin is the same. It depends only on the distance from the centre, not the direction from the centre. So the probability density function can be simplified to <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, as a function of the radius. And since the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, we know from pythagoras that <span class="math inline">\(r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P_{X,Y}(X = x,Y = y) = \omega (\sqrt{x^2+y^2})
\]</span></p>
<p>The second bullet point (2) - is that there is no correlation between whether you shoot too high/low and whether you shoot too far left/right. This assumption of independence is a crucial, and commonly used assumption in statistics.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P_{X,Y}(X=x,Y=y) = P_X(X=x) \times P_Y(Y=y)
\]</span></p>
<p>And hence we can combine the two:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\omega (\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) = P_X(x) \times P_Y(y)
\]</span></p>

<p>Now you might be thinking at this point - why start with two distributions? It would be easier to derive the normal distribution from just one variable, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. However, initially providing a second independent variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (which we now remove) provides a shortcut to derive the normal distribution for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, so it is a useful step.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is i.i.d, then the probability density <span class="math inline">\(g(Y=0)\)</span> is constant regardless of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(P_Y(0) = \gamma\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is some constant). We can similarly denote the constant <span class="math inline">\(P_X(0) = \lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, for any distance <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
\omega(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})
&amp; = P_X(x) \times P_Y(y)
\\
\therefore \omega(\sqrt{x^2+0^2})
&amp; = P_X(x) \times P_Y(0)
\\
\equiv \omega(x) &amp; = P_X(x) \times \gamma
\\
\therefore \omega(\sqrt{0^2+y^2})
&amp; = P_X(0) \times P_Y(y)
\\
\equiv \omega(y) &amp; = \lambda \times P_Y(y)
\\
\\
\Rightarrow \omega(z) &amp; = \gamma P_X(z) \\
\Rightarrow P_Y(z)
&amp; = \frac{\omega(z)}{\lambda}
= \frac{\gamma}{\lambda}P_X(z)
\end{align}
}
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words - we can represent the joint pdf of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> solely in terms of <span class="math inline">\(P_X(z)\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
\omega (\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) &amp; = P_X(x) \times P_Y(y) \\
\equiv
\gamma P_X(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) &amp; = P_X(x) \times
\frac{\gamma}{\lambda}P_X(y)
\end{align}
}
\]</span></p>
<p>And we can simplify this further, using a helper function <span class="math inline">\(h(z)\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
\gamma P_X(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) &amp; = P_X(x) \times
\frac{\gamma}{\lambda}P_X(y) \\
\Rightarrow P_X(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) &amp; = P_X(x) \times
\frac{P_X(y)}{\lambda} &amp; \div \gamma \\
\Rightarrow \frac{P_X(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})}{\lambda} &amp; = \frac{P_X(x)}{\lambda} \times
\frac{P_X(y)}{\lambda} &amp; \div \lambda \\
\equiv h(x^2+y^2) &amp; = h(x^2) \times h(y^2) &amp; \text{where } h(z) = \frac{P_X(\sqrt{z})}{\lambda} \\
\end{align}
}
\]</span></p>
<p>We now have everything in terms of one function, <span class="math inline">\(h(z)\)</span>. We now look to find a form for <span class="math inline">\(h(z)\)</span> that satisfies this criteria.</p>

<section id="ensuring-finite-variance" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ensuring-finite-variance">Ensuring finite variance</h2>
<p>So far we have that: <span class="math display">\[
P_X(x) = \lambda e^{kx^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>We can determine that <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> <strong>must</strong> be a negative value. The reasoning behind this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The variance is finite, so the probability density must diminish with large values of <span class="math inline">\(|x|\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(kx^2 &lt; 0\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> is positive for all real <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> has to be negative to ensure <span class="math inline">\(kx^2 &lt; 0\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>So going forward, let’s substitute <span class="math inline">\(k=-\left(m^2\right)\)</span>, to ensure it is a negative number for any real value of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P_X(x) = \lambda e^{kx^2} = \lambda e^{-m^2x^2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Furthermore - we know that the integral between <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span> must equal one, since this is the full range of values that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> could take, and the probabilities must sum to one.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\lambda \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{e^{-m^2x^2} \, dx} = 1
\]</span></p>
<p>And we can use both of these deductions to find a value for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
\text{Let } u &amp; = mx \\

\therefore
\lambda \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{e^{-m^2x^2} \,dx}
&amp; = \lambda \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{e^{-u^2} \,\frac{du}{m}} \\
&amp; = \frac{\lambda}{m} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{e^{-u^2} \,du}
\\
&amp; = \frac{\lambda}{m} \left[ -\frac{1}{2u} \times e^{-u^2} \right]_{-\infty}^{+\infty}
\\
&amp; = \frac{\lambda}{m} \sqrt{\pi}

<section id="reformulating-to-include-a-standard-deviation-term" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reformulating-to-include-a-standard-deviation-term">Reformulating to include a standard deviation term</h2>
<p>So we are closer to deriving our standard normal probability density function, but we have a <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> constant instead of the constant variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. It might not be surprising then that it turns out this variance is a function of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p>To help see this, consider the point <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>, where we find that the height of the pdf is <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> (i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(P_X(0) = \lambda e^{-\pi \lambda^20^2} = \lambda\)</span>). So the higher the value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, the larger the probability of getting closer to the centre (since the cdf must equal one), and hence the smaller the variance. In other words - the variance has to be a function of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p>To understand the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, let’s plug <span class="math inline">\(P_X(x) = \lambda e^{-\pi \lambda^2x^2}\)</span> into the standard calculation for the variance of any pdf:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
\sigma^2
&amp; = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{(x-\mu)^2 \times P_X(x) \, dx} \\
&amp; = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{(x-\mu)^2 \times \lambda e^{-\pi \lambda^2x^2} \, dx} \\
&amp; = \lambda \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{x^2 \times e^{-\pi \lambda^2x^2} \, dx} &amp; \because \mu = 0 \\
\end{align}
}
\]</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Then we can integrate by parts, i.e.&nbsp;using the form <span class="math inline">\(\int{u \, dv} = uv - \int{v \, du}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
\text{Let } u &amp; = x
\text{ and } dv = x e^{-\pi \lambda^2 (x^2)} dx \\
\Rightarrow du &amp; = dx  
&amp; \because \frac{du}{dx} = 1 \\
\Rightarrow v &amp; = -\frac{1}{2\pi \lambda^2} e^{-\pi \lambda^2 x^2}
\\ \\
\Rightarrow
\sigma^2 &amp; =
\lambda \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{x \times \lambda e^{-\pi \lambda^2(x^2)} \, dx}
= \lambda
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{u \, dv}
\\ &amp; = \lambda \left( uv -\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{v \, dv} \right)
\\
&amp; = \lambda \left( \left[ x\left(
  \frac{-1}{2 \pi \lambda^2} e^{-\pi \lambda^2 x^2}
  \right) \right]_{-\infty}^{+\infty} -
  \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{
    \frac{-1}{2 \pi \lambda^2} e^{-\pi \lambda^2 x^2}
    \, dx}
  \right)
\end{align}
}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now as both <span class="math inline">\(x \rightarrow \infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x \rightarrow -\infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(e^{-\pi \lambda^2 x^2}\rightarrow 0\)</span>, so the first term drops out entirely.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
\sigma^2
&amp; = \lambda \left( \cancel{ \left[ x\left(
  \frac{-1}{2 \pi \lambda^2} e^{-\pi \lambda^2 x^2}
  \right) \right]_{-\infty}^{+\infty} } -
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{
    \frac{-1}{2 \pi \lambda^2} e^{-\pi \lambda^2 x^2}

  \right)
\\ &amp; = \lambda
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{
    \frac{1}{2 \pi \lambda^2} e^{-\pi \lambda^2 x^2}
    \, dx}
\\ &amp; = \frac{1}{2 \pi \lambda^2}
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{
    \lambda e^{-\pi \lambda^2 x^2}
    \, dx}
\\ &amp; = \frac{1}{2 \pi \lambda^2}
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{P_X(x) \, dx}
\\ &amp; = \frac{1}{2 \pi \lambda^2}
&amp; \because \text{pdfs must sum to 1}
\\
\\
\therefore \lambda &amp; = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}
\end{align}
}
\]</span></p>
<p>And now we can plug <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> back into <span class="math inline">\(P_X(x)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
P_X(x) = \lambda e^{-\pi \lambda^2x^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{\frac{-x^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\end{align}
}
\]</span></p>
<p>Which gives us the normal distribution (where <span class="math inline">\(\mu=0\)</span>).</p>
<p>Fin.</p>
