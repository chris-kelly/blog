We derive if from first principles i.e. proving the Herschel-Maxwell theorem.\n:::\n\n## Setting the scene\n\nImagine we are throwing darts, aiming at a circular target. The closer you get to the centre, the more points you get.\n\nImagine you miss the centre by 5cm. It doesn't matter whether you were 5cm too high or low, 5cm too far left or right, or a combination of the two (e.g. 3cm too far left, 4cm too far right, which by pythagoras is also $\\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5\\text{cm}$ away from the centre) - hitting those regions are all equally likely.\n\n::: {#7388fafa .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport

We are just trying to aim for the middle: getting less or more accurate horizontally doesn't affect how accurate we are vertically.\n\nLet's denote the horizontal and vertical distances from the centre $X$ and $Y$. Now here is the magic - after taking many shots, we would find that **the distribution of vertical distances from the centre of the target would follow a normal distribution**!\n\nWe would also find

like very, very few assumptions needed to know that the horizontal and vertical distances will follow a normal distribution? That's true! But it works. This is the Herschel-Maxwell theorem.\n\n:::{.callout-tip title=\"Herschel-Maxwell theorem\"}\nGiven two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, with a joint distribution function of $P_{X,Y}(dX,dY)$:\n\n1. $P_{X,Y}$ is invariant to real rotations\n2. $X, Y$ are independent\n\nThen both $X$ and $Y$ are normally distributed.\n:::\n\nAnd this is the theorem that we will prove in this post.\n\n## First step - combining the two assumptions\n\nThe horizontal and vertical distances from the centre are two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, that are independently and identically generated from a distribution with identical population parameters (mean of zero and finite, constant variance).\n\n:::{.column-margin}\nWe do not expect a bias in aiming too high or too low. Hence the expected values of $X$ and $Y$ (their means) are zero: $\\mathbb{E}[X]=0\\text{; }\\mathbb{E}[Y]=0$ \n\nAlso, we want to hit closer to the centre. Hence the probability density must diminish with large values of $|x|$, as it is more likely we get closer - so the variance of these distances is finite. Also, by making the variance constant, we assume that we do not get better over time. $\\mathbb{V}[X]=c_X\\text{; }\\mathbb{V}[Y]=c_Y$\n:::\n\nLet's now derive the normal distribution from first principles. We rewrite the Herschel-Maxwell theorem above as our starting point:\n\n1. The probability of hitting a point on the target is radially symmetric\n2. The horizontal and vertical distances from the centre are independent (unrelated)\n\nWhat does this really mean? Well (1) means there is \"radial symmetry\". In other words, the likelihood of a shot ending in some region is only based on how close it is to the centre: it doesn't matter how far the distance is along the horizontal or vertical axis ($X$ or $Y$), just the combined distance (i.e. the radius from the centre).\n\n$$\n\\displaylines{\n\\begin{gather}\nP_{X,Y}(X = x, Y = y) = P_{X,Y}(X = x', Y = y') \\\\\n\\iff x^2 + y^2 = x'^2 + y'^2\n\\end{gather}\n}\n$$\n\nConcretely - the joint probability between $X$ and $Y$ for two shots landing in any region equidistant from the origin is the same. It depends only on the distance from the centre, not the direction from the centre. So the probability density function can be simplified to $\\omega$, as a function of the radius. And since the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, we know from pythagoras that $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$:\n\n$$\nP_{X,Y}(X = x,Y = y) = \\omega (\\sqrt{x^2+y^2})\n$$\n\nThe second bullet point (2) - is that there is no correlation between whether you shoot too high/low and whether you shoot too far left/right. This assumption of independence is a crucial, and commonly used assumption in statistics.\n\n$$\nP_{X,Y}(X=x,Y=y) = P_X(X=x) \\times P_Y(Y=y)\n$$\n\nAnd hence we can combine the two:\n\n$$\n \\omega (\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) = P_X(x) \\times P_Y(y)\n$$\n\n## Simplifying to a single pdf\n\nNow you might be thinking at this point - why start with two distributions? It would be easier to derive the normal distribution from just one variable, $X$. However, initially providing a second independent variable $Y$ (which we now remove) provides a shortcut to derive the normal distribution for $X$, so it is a useful step.\n\nSince $Y$ is i.i.d, then the probability density $g(Y=0)$ is constant regardless of $X$ (i.e. $P_Y(0) = \\gamma$ where $\\gamma$ is some constant). We can similarly denote the constant $P_X(0) = \\lambda$.\n\nThus, for any distance $z$:\n\n$$\n\\displaylines{\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2})\n& = P_X(x) \\times P_Y(y) \n\\\\\n\\therefore \\omega(\\sqrt{x^2+0^2})\n& = P_X(x) \\times P_Y(0)\n\\\\\n\\equiv \\omega(x) & = P_X(x) \\times \\gamma\n\\\\\n\\therefore \\omega(\\sqrt{0^2+y^2})\n& = P_X(0) \\times P_Y(y)\n\\\\\n\\equiv \\omega(y) & = \\lambda \\times P_Y(y)\n\\\\\n\\\\ \n\\Rightarrow \\omega(z) & = \\gamma P_X(z) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow P_Y(z) \n& = \\frac{\\omega(z)}{\\lambda} \n= \\frac{\\gamma}{\\lambda}P_X(z)\n\\end{align}\n}\n$$\n\nIn other words - we can represent the joint pdf of $X$ and $Y$ solely in terms of $P_X(z)$:\n$$\n\\displaylines{\n\\begin{align}\n\\omega (\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) & = P_X(x) \\times P_Y(y) \\\\\n\\equiv \n\\gamma P_X(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) & = P_X(x) \\times \n\\frac{\\gamma}{\\lambda}P_X(y)\n\\end{align}\n}\n$$\n\nAnd we can simplify this further, using a helper function $h(z)$:\n$$\n\\displaylines{\n\\begin{align}\n\\gamma P_X(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) & = P_X(x) \\times \n\\frac{\\gamma}{\\lambda}P_X(y) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow P_X(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) & = P_X(x) \\times \n \\frac{P_X(y)}{\\lambda} & \\div \\gamma \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{P_X(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2})}{\\lambda} & = \\frac{P_X(x)}{\\lambda} \\times \n \\frac{P_X(y)}{\\lambda} & \\div \\lambda \\\\\n\\equiv h(x^2+y^2) & = h(x^2) \\times h(y^2) & \\text{where } h(z) = \\frac{P_X(\\sqrt{z})}{\\lambda} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n}\n$$\n\nWe now have everything in terms of one function, $h(z)$. We now look to find a form for $h(z)$ that satisfies this criteria.\n\n## Satisfying the equality using exponentials\n\nAn exponential function is a good candidate to ensure that multiplying each pdf together is the same as raising it to the sum of their powers:\n\n:::{.column-margin}\nNote that for any base $b$, we can reformulate it in terms of the natural number $e$[^1], i.e. setting $h(z^2) = e^{kz^2}$\n:::\n\n$$\n\\displaylines{\n\\begin{align}\nb^{(x^2+y^2)} & = b^{x^2} \\times b^{y^2}\n\\\\ \\equiv \ne^{kx^2+ky^2} & = e^{kx^2} \\times e^{ky^2}\n& \\text{where } k = \\ln{[b]}\n\\\\\n\\therefore h(z) & = e^{kx^2}\n\\end{align}\n}\n$$\n\nAnd thus:\n$$\nP_X(x) = \\lambda h(x^2) = \\lambda e^{kx^2}\n$$\n\nWe now have a pdf that is an exponential form - we are getting closer!\n\n## Ensuring finite variance\n\nSo far we have that:\n$$\nP_X(x) = \\lambda e^{kx^2}\n$$\n\nWe can determine that $k$ **must** be a negative value. The reasoning behind this:\n\n* The variance is finite, so the probability density must diminish with large values of $|x|$. Thus, $kx^2 < 0$\n* $x^2$ is positive for all real $x$, so $k$ has to be negative to ensure $kx^2 < 0$ \n\nSo going forward, let's substitute $k=-\\left(m^2\\right)$, to ensure it is a negative number for any real value of $m$.\n\n$$\nP_X(x) = \\lambda e^{kx^2} = \\lambda e^{-m^2x^2}\n$$\n\nFurthermore - we know that the integral between $-\\infty$ and $+\\infty$ must equal one, since this is the full range of values that $x$ could take, and the probabilities must sum to one.\n\n$$\n\\lambda \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{e^{-m^2x^2} \\, dx} = 1\n$$\n\nAnd we can use both of these deductions to find a value for $m$:\n\n$$\n\\displaylines{\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Let } u & = mx \\\\\n\\Rightarrow dx & = \\frac{du}{m} \\text{ } & \\because \\frac{du}{dx} = m \n\\\\ \\\\\n\\therefore \n\\lambda \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{e^{-m^2x^2} \\,dx}\n& = \\lambda \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{e^{-u^2} \\,\\frac{du}{m}} \\\\\n& = \\frac{\\lambda}{m} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{e^{-u^2} \\,du}\n\\\\\n& = \\frac{\\lambda}{m} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2u} \\times e^{-u^2} \\right]_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\n\\\\\n& = \\frac{\\lambda}{m} \\sqrt{\\pi} \n& \\because \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{e^{-z^2}}{dz} = \\sqrt{\\pi}\n\\\\\n& = 1\n\\\\ \\\\\n\\therefore m & = \\lambda \\sqrt{\\pi}\n\\end{align}\n}\n$$\n\n:::{.column-margin}\nThe integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{e^{-z^2}}{dz} = \\sqrt{\\pi}$ is a special case: of the gaussian integral. [See this page](fundamentals_gaussian_integral.html) if you are interested in its derivation.\n:::\nAnd thus:\n\n$$\n\\displaylines{\n\\begin{align}\nP_X(x) = \\lambda e^{-m^2x^2} = \\lambda e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2x^2}\n\\end{align}\n}\n$$\n\n## Reformulating to include a standard deviation term\n\nSo we are closer to deriving our standard normal probability density function, but we have a $\\lambda$ constant instead of the constant variance $\\sigma^2$. It might not be surprising then that it turns out this variance is a function of $\\lambda$.\n\nTo help see this, consider the point $x=0$, where we find that the height of the pdf is $\\lambda$ (i.e. $P_X(0) = \\lambda e^{-\\pi \\lambda^20^2} = \\lambda$). So the higher the value of $\\lambda$, the larger the probability of getting closer to the centre (since the cdf must equal one), and hence the smaller the variance. In other words - the variance has to be a function of $\\lambda$.\n\nTo understand the relationship between $\\lambda$ and $\\sigma^2$, let's plug $P_X(x) = \\lambda e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2x^2}$ into the standard calculation for the variance of any pdf:\n\n$$\n\\displaylines{\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma^2 \n& = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{(x-\\mu)^2 \\times P_X(x) \\, dx} \\\\\n& = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{(x-\\mu)^2 \\times \\lambda e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2x^2} \\, dx} \\\\\n& = \\lambda \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{x^2 \\times e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2x^2} \\, dx} & \\because \\mu = 0 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n}\n$$\n\n<br>\n\nThen we can integrate by parts, i.e. using the form $\\int{u \\, dv} = uv - \\int{v \\, du}$:\n\n$$\n\\displaylines{\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Let } u & = x \n\\text{ and } dv = x e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2 (x^2)} dx \\\\\n\\Rightarrow du & = dx  \n& \\because \\frac{du}{dx} = 1 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow v & = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi \\lambda^2} e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2 x^2}\n\\\\ \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\n\\sigma^2 & = \n\\lambda \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{x \\times \\lambda e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2(x^2)} \\, dx} \n= \\lambda \n\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{u \\, dv}\n\\\\ & = \\lambda \\left( uv -\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{v \\, dv} \\right)\n\\\\\n& = \\lambda \\left( \\left[ x\\left( \n  \\frac{-1}{2 \\pi \\lambda^2} e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2 x^2}\n  \\right) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} - \n  \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{\n    \\frac{-1}{2 \\pi \\lambda^2} e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2 x^2} \n    \\, dx}\n  \\right)\n\\end{align}\n}\n$$\n\nNow as both $x \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $x \\rightarrow -\\infty$, $e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2 x^2}\\rightarrow 0$, so the first term drops out entirely.\n\n$$\n\\displaylines{\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma^2\n& = \\lambda \\left( \\cancel{ \\left[ x\\left( \n  \\frac{-1}{2 \\pi \\lambda^2} e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2 x^2}\n  \\right) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} } - \n  \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{\n    \\frac{-1}{2 \\pi \\lambda^2} e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2 x^2} \n    \\, dx}\n  \\right)\n\\\\ & = \\lambda\n  \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{\n    \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\lambda^2} e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2 x^2} \n    \\, dx}\n\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\lambda^2}\n  \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{\n    \\lambda e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2 x^2} \n    \\, dx}\n\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\lambda^2}\n  \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{P_X(x) \\, dx}\n\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\lambda^2}\n& \\because \\text{pdfs must sum to 1}\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\therefore \\lambda & = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\n\\end{align}\n}\n$$\n\nAnd now we can plug $\\lambda$ back into $P_X(x)$:\n\n$$\n\\displaylines{\n\\begin{align}\nP_X(x) = \\lambda e^{-\\pi \\lambda^2x^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{\\frac{-x^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n\\end{align}\n}\n$$\n\nWhich gives us the normal distribution (where $\\mu=0$).\n\nFin.\n\n[^1]:\n  For any base $b$, we can reformulate it in terms of the natural number $e$\n  $$\n  \\displaylines{\n  \\begin{align}\n  b^{x^2} & = e^{kx^2} \\\\\n  \\therefore \\ln{b^{x^2}} & = kx^2 \\\\\n  \\therefore x^2 \\ln{b} & = kx^2 \\\\\n  \\therefore \\ln{b} & = k \\\\\n  \\end{align}\n  }\n  $$\n\n",
