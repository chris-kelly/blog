    "A \"token\" is a small piece of text. When text data is provided it is split into smaller consistuent pieces (e.g. a sentence is split into words, usually after stemming and stop-word removal). In our example, the tokenisation step involves one-hot encoding each unique word.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"document\" is a collection of tokens associated with a particular sample. In our example, each document will be a restaurant menu. \n",

    "An \"embedding\" is an attempt to create numerical representation of that document in a vector. In our example, we hope that the most important tokens will have the largest values.\n",

    "Text-frequency Inverse-Document-Frequency (TF-IDF) is a technique to find the most important tokens in a document. It is thus a form of information retrieval/text-mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- It is good at determining 'global' statistics. By this, we mean it contrasts  the frequency of tokens in a document vs their prevalence across the entire corpus. It does not capture more detailed semantic relationships, particularly since it doesn't care about the ordering of words in a document. -->\n",

    "<!-- Note further that it is heuristic-based. This means that although the TF-IDF -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the intuition?\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is based on the intuition that tokens that appear more frequently, especially those that are rarer across the entire corpus, are the most important ones relating to that document.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's contrast two takeaway menus:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Chicken Kurma Masala, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Curry, Saag Aloo, Pilau Rice, Plain Rice\n",
    "* Chicken Chow Mein Noodles, Crispy Beef, Chicken and Cashew nut curry, Prawn Crackers, Egg Fried Rice, Steamed rice, Vegetable Noodles\n",

    "The word 'Chicken' appears the most in the first menu, followed by 'masasla' and 'Rice'. This is \"text frequency\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's only half the story - since chicken and rice are quite common words in general. So we need a way to measure if a word is rare. The word 'masala' only appears in the first menu, whereas 'chicken' and 'rice' appears in both orders. Hence, the rareness of a word can be determined by how infrequently it appears across all the documents in the corpus. This is \"inverse document frequency\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining text-frequency and inverse-document frequency scores for each token give it a TF-IDF score. This way, we can derive that the word 'masala' is the most important word from the first order, since it has both high TF and IDF scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.column-margin}\n",
    "TF-IDF can also be done for words, for example splitting the word `manner` into character tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n` appears twice in the word\n",
    "* `m` is rarer\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine now that three of the letters are dropped. We are much more likely to guess that the word `m_nn_` could be manner, whereas seeing `_a__er` is far less informative.\n",

If we have another document that has high TF-IF scores for masala, chicken and rice, and low scores for noodles and fried, we might think it is similar to the first order. Cosine similarity gives a measure between one and zero as to how similar the two texts are.\n",
