## What we are exploring
Cmparing OLS and GLM
:::

### 
GLM is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression:

* Permits the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function
* Allow the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value

Formally we can state that:
$$
\displaylines{
\begin{align}
E[y|X] & = \mu = g^{-1}{(X\beta)} \\
V[y|X] & = V[g^{-1}{(X\beta)}]
\end{align}
}
$$
